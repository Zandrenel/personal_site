** Dependencies
| Package    | Last Used Version | Reason                            |
|------------+-------------------+-----------------------------------|
| swi-prolog |           10.0.0  | Run the actual Application/Server |
| python     |          3.10.2-1 | Run the engine project            |
| docker     |        1:23.0.6-1 | Build/run the dockerfile          |
** Commands
*** Run the Server
**** Basic
***** swipl -g "server(3030,[dev])" server.pl
This command ran from the root of the repository will using swipl consult the server.pl file with the predicate server(Port,Options). The port can be whatever port you want to run the server on, and the options part currently accepts dev, prod, and docker as options. Running it with dev will run the server with no certificates as just http, running with prod will have it try to find the certificates and run using them for https. Running either with the docker option will run using the ~thread_get_message(_)~ call at the end of them which will stop the program from reaching EOF and just halting which is a common problem when trying to run the http_server with docker or as a service otherwise.
**** Docker
***** docker build ./ -t swi-site
This will build the image from  the Dockerfile included in the root directory.
***** docker run -d -p 3030:3030 swi-site
This will run the built docker image as a daemon with ports 3030 and 3030 for http for https open.
***** docker ps
This shows the running docker processes
***** docker stop <id>
This ran with the first X characters of the docker process for the image will stop it.
***** docker restart <id>
This will restart the running container with the first X digits of the id.
